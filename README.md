# JudgingScripts
Judging scripts for hackillinois 2020 table, project, rating, and judge assignments

To run the judge -> table assignment, fix the values at the top of the file, and give each judge the set of numbers printed from running the script

To run the rating script (which add total scores and aggregates multiple judging submissions into one line), download the csv from our form responses, name the file correctly, and a new csv will be generated that may be sorted in descending order
